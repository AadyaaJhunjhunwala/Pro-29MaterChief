**Red Velvet Cake**

The classic red velvet cake – an iconic, much-loved classic that has been around for decades! Every pastry chef has their recipe for this visually stunning cake! The red color is courtesy of plenty of red food coloring and cocoa powder. My simple recipe made with homemade buttermilk yields a moist, tender and delicious cake! I frost the cake with a simple cream cheese frosting and to garnish the cake, chocolate covered strawberries! I love the simple yet elegant finish. This cake is perfect for special occasions or for the holidays!

**How to Make Red Velvet Cake**

* This rich, red-colored cake is actually a chocolate cake in disguise! I make my cake layers with buttermilk, sugar, eggs and butter. The buttermilk helps intensify the red color of the cake! Since buttermilk is not readily available everywhere, I created this recipe with homemade buttermilk – whole milk and vinegar/lemon juice. If you are able to get buttermilk, use that instead. 

* Next, add in the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder and cocoa powder. The cocoa powder will add amazing chocolate flavor! This recipe calls for just 2 tablespoons of cocoa. You don’t want to add too much cocoa, otherwise you’ll love the beautiful red color of the cake! Allow the cake layers to cool completely before adding the frosting! 


**Cream Cheese Frosting**


* Use a full-fat brick cream cheese, not low fat or spreadable cream cheese. 

* Use unsalted butter and add a dash of salt so that you have complete control over the flavor of the frosting. 

* Allow your cream cheese and your butter to soften before making your frosting. Softening the butter and cream cheese ensure that your ingredients will combine well and be lump free. 

* To pipe your frosting, sift your powdered sugar before mixing it into your butter/cream cheese mixture, as small lumps of sugar can clog up your piping tips, especially if you’re using a smaller tip. 


* Beat the softened cream cheese for 5 to 7 minutes, until it’s really smooth and creamy. You don’t want any clumps in the frosting! To ensure it’s smooth, scrape down the sides of your mixing bowl often to get everything incorporated!
